Fill in starting balance and click play game.

Place your bets. This can be done in two ways, either by dragging a betting chip over the hand that you want to bet on, or by first clicking on the chip and thereafter on the hand that you want to bet on. By clicking the undo-button you undo your last bet, and by clicking the double-button you double all your bets.

When you're done placing your bets, click deal.

The round is now gonna play out.

To play another round, place your bets and again click the deal-button.

If you run out of money (or you run out of cards, you're playing with six card-decks consisting of 52 cards), the game will end. If you don't want to continue playing, just close the browser/tab.

You can mute/un-mute sounds by clicking the mute-button in the top left corner.

Enjoy!
